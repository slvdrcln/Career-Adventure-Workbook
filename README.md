# Career-Adventure-Workbook
This application helps the user prepare for an execute the search for a new job. It is based on the book "Your Career Adventure Workbook" by Darin Phillips of DarinPhillips.com. 
Users start by identifying stories from their career (or college) that highlight their awesomeness - or lessons learned. These stories are broken into four sections: S is for the Situation that the user was in. T is for what the user was Thinking at that time. A is for the actual Actions that the user took. R is for the Results that were achieved.
By pouring over the various STAR stories, users should be able to identify patterns and themes that can be used to create a brief elevator speech. This is how the user should introduce themselves during the job search.
Users are then guided through the process of documenting their prior experiences in a way that provokes interest by both recruiters and hiring managers. Users must tempt the resume readers to ask about the STAR stories.
The app also provides guidance on how to identify keywords in job postings and use them in their profile/resume. 
Finally, the app helps the user 'sell' themselves. The user creates a search strategy, networks into the company(s) they are interested in, and keeps tabs on every contact and conversation.
